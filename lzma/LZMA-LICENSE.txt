(These are the licensing details for this directory, taken from lzma.txt in
 the original source distribution. The basic gist is you can do what you want
 with this code, including sell it in a closed-source app...changes to LZMA
 itself must be released as source code, which in the case of PhysicsFS, you
 can just point people to our source code repository unless you make further
 changes yourself.  --ryan.)

LZMA SDK 4.27  Copyright (C) 1999-2005 Igor Pavlov

LZMA SDK provides developers with documentation, source code,
and sample code necessary to write software that uses LZMA compression. 

LZMA is default and general compression method of 7z format
in 7-Zip compression program (www.7-zip.org). LZMA provides high 
compression ratio and very fast decompression.

LZMA is an improved version of famous LZ77 compression algorithm. 
It was improved in way of maximum increasing of compression ratio,
keeping high decompression speed and low memory requirements for 
decompressing.
