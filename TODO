Stuff that needs to be done and wishlist:

These are in no particular order. A 1.0 release is reliant on doing most of
 this stuff. Some might be dupes, some might be done already.

- Include the Visual Studio (6 and .NET) project files in CVS directly.
- A PHYSFS_readUint32(), _readSint32(), etc API.
- Write manpages, preferrably generated from some javadoc-style solution
  so we can make HTML versions etc from the same data.
- Improve ZIP_seek() (archivers/zip.c)
- Make the zipfile parse symlinks with relative paths. See the function
  expand_symlink_path() in archivers/zip.c ...
- Actually, the zipfile driver could use a lot of tweaking. Please look
  through it.
- Other archivers: perhaps tar(.gz|.bz2), RPM, etc. These are less
  important, since streaming archives aren't of much value to games (which
  is why zipfiles are king: random access), but it could have uses for, say,
  an installer/updater. I thought it might be neat to have MBOX and Maildir
  support so that both "archives" look identical to an application; might be
  nice for an email program. That's blue sky, unless someone wants to tackle
  it.
- Look for FIXMEs (many marked with "!!!" in comments).
- Port to MacOS X (specifically, make Project Builder files; unix.c should
  work with it as-is. Might compile as-is with autoconf.)
- Probably other stuff. Requests and recommendations are welcome.
- Fill in __PHYSFS_platformGetLastModTime() in all the platform drivers.
- Implement getlastmodtime for zip.c ... zipfiles contain file modtimes.
- Implement getlastmodtime for grp.c ... all files report modtime of archive?

// end of TODO ...
